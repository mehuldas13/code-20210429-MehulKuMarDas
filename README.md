Python Developer Assessment: (You should be completing the assessment on Github)

Python Backend Developer
Python BMI Calculator Coding Challenge
Problem Statement:
Given the following JSON data:
[{"Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 171, "WeightKg": 96 }, { "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 161, "WeightKg":
85 }, { "Gender": "Male", "HeightCm": 180, "WeightKg": 77 }, { "Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 166,
"WeightKg": 62}, {"Gender": "Female", "HeightCm": 150, "WeightKg": 70}, {"Gender": "Female",
"HeightCm": 167, "WeightKg": 82} as the input with weight and height parameters of a person].

1) Write a solid production-grade Python3 Program to solve this problem, imagine
this will be used in-product for 1 Lac patients. We are only interested in a standalone
backend application, we are NOT expecting a UI, webpage, frontend, Mobile App,
microsite etc. We want to see what optimal solution you come up with to scale for larger
JSON data and perform calculations quickly and write the output efficiently. Feel free to
explore and use the standard Python libraries or any open source Python modules
2) Automate the setup, build, test, package and run using your favourite tools
